The translated model is a DAE. Integrating using DAE solver.

Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dassault Systemes))
Integration terminated successfully at T = 120
  WARNING: You have many time events. This is probably due to fast sampling.
